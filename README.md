Web application that, using OpenWeather API, provides user with weather information for cites of their choice. The cities current date, weather conditions (in the form of an icon), temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV Index are provided. The UV Index element changes color depending on UV severity. The city's weather conditions (also an icon), wind speed, and humidity, are also provided for the next five days. All searched cities are stored and displayed as buttons on the page. Clicking any of the previously searched cities will provide the user with the relevant information again.
